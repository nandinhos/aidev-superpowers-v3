# Generic Stack Rules

## Core Principles
These rules apply to ALL projects regardless of stack.

## 1. TDD is Mandatory
- **RED**: Write failing test first
- **GREEN**: Minimal code to pass
- **REFACTOR**: Improve without breaking

## 2. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Don't add functionality until needed
- Avoid premature optimization  
- Build only what's requested

## 3. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Each piece of knowledge has single source
- Extract when repeated 3+ times
- But don't over-abstract early

## 4. Clean Code
- Meaningful names
- Small functions (≤20 lines)
- Single responsibility
- Clear separation of concerns

## 5. Error Handling
- Fail fast
- Clear error messages
- Proper exception types
- Log appropriately

## 6. Version Control
- Atomic commits
- Descriptive messages in ENGLISH
- Branch per feature
- Review before merge

## Commit Message Format

**MANDATORY RULES**:
- Language: ENGLISH (Mandatory)
- Emojis: FORBIDDEN
- Co-authorship: FORBIDDEN (No Co-Authored-By)

### Format
```
type(scope): short description in english

- Detail 1 (optional)
- Detail 2 (optional)
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code change (no new feature)
- `test`: Adding tests
- `docs`: Documentation
- `chore`: Maintenance

### Examples
```
feat(auth): add JWT authentication
fix(api): fix email validation
refactor(utils): extract formatting function
```

### DO NOT DO
```
# WRONG - emoji
feat(auth): :sparkles: add authentication

# WRONG - mixed language/portuguese
feat(auth): adiciona auth

# WRONG - co-authorship
feat(auth): add auth

```

## File Organization
- Group by feature, not type
- Clear naming conventions
- Consistent structure
- Separate config from code

## Documentation
- README for every project
- Inline comments for "why"
- API documentation
- Architecture decisions

{{#if PROJECT_NAME}}
## Project: {{PROJECT_NAME}}
{{/if}}
