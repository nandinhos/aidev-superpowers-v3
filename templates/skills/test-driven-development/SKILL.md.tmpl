# Test-Driven Development Skill

## When to Use
During ALL implementation work. Non-negotiable.

## The Cycle

### RED Phase
1. Write a failing test
2. Test MUST fail for the right reason
3. Verify the failure message

```bash
npm test -- feature.spec.js
# Expected: FAIL - feature not implemented
```

### GREEN Phase
1. Write MINIMAL code to pass
2. No extra features
3. No premature optimization
4. Just make it pass

```bash
npm test -- feature.spec.js
# Expected: PASS
```

### REFACTOR Phase
1. Improve code quality
2. Remove duplication
3. Enhance readability
4. Tests MUST still pass

```bash
npm test
# Expected: All PASS
```

### COMMIT Phase
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add feature X with tests"
```

## CRITICAL RULE
**If code exists without tests: DELETE IT and start over!**

This is non-negotiable. Code without tests is technical debt.

## Testing Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Test After Implementation
❌ Write code → Write test
✅ Write test → Write code

### 2. Testing Implementation Details
❌ `expect(spy.toHaveBeenCalledWith(...))`
✅ `expect(result).toBe(...)`

### 3. Tests That Always Pass
❌ No assertions
❌ Catching all exceptions
✅ Specific assertions that can fail

### 4. Flaky Tests
❌ Depend on timing
❌ Depend on external state
✅ Isolated, deterministic

### 5. Testing the Framework
❌ Testing that React renders
✅ Testing YOUR component logic

## Test Structure
```javascript
describe('Feature', () => {
  // Setup
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Arrange
  });

  it('should do X when Y', () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = ...;
    
    // Act
    const result = feature(input);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(expected);
  });

  // Teardown
  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup
  });
});
```

## Coverage Goals
- Unit tests: 80%+ coverage
- Integration tests: Critical paths
- E2E tests: Happy paths + error cases

## Tools by Stack
- **JavaScript**: Jest, Vitest, Testing Library
- **PHP**: PHPUnit, Pest
- **Python**: pytest, unittest
- **Go**: testing package
